UIUC: UAV Navigation and Control

.mat files required for visualization

Lab 3: simulation and code to visualize simulation
  Getting quadrotor to follow a stationary/moving desired position

  
Lab 4: simulation and code to visualize simulation 
  Implemented obstacle avoidance
  Simulation generates random obstacles
  
Lab 5: pre-experiment simulation and simulation of experiment
  Tracking an object
  Pre-experiment simulation used for proof of concept and predicting performance
  .mat files contain data returned from experiment, used to simulate for error analysis 
  Lab4_visualize can be used to visualize simulations
